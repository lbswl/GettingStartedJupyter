# Getting Started Using Jupyter Notebook

In this tutorial we go through the basics of using Jupyter Notebooks for Python programs. Also, we give examples of a few advanced concepts such as executing shell commands, autosaving, and timing execution. 

## Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter notebook is an open-source web application that you can use to share documents that contain live code, visualizations, equations, and text. It supports Julia, Python, and R. You can export a Jupyter Notebook to HTML, PDF, LaTeX, and Markdown (see [Sharing and Publishing Jupyter Notebooks](https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/publication-RR-Jupyter/02-exporting_the_notebook/index.html)). Jupyter notebooks are widely used in the Data Science community for reproducibility and collaboration. 

## Installing Jupyter Notebook

To install Jupyter Notebook, you have two options:

* Run command **pip**.

    ```
    $ pip install jupyter
    ```

* Install [Anaconda](http://www.anaconda.com) which contains many scientific libraries preinstalled.
  
   **Note:** This is recommended but not a must have.
## Starting the Jupyter Notebook Server

To get started using the Jupyter Notebook Server, run command:

```
$ jupyter notebook
```
